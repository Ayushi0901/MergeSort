# Merge sort
This is the Python Program for performing Merge sort .


**What is Merge Sort? 

Merge Sort is based on the divide and conquer algorithm where the input array is divided into two halves, then sorted separately and merged back to reach the output.

**What do you mean by " Divide and Conquer approach"?

*The array is split in half and the process is repeated with each half until each half is of size 1 or 0. 

*The array of size 1 is trivially sorted.

*Now the two sorted arrays are combined into one big array. And this is continued until all the elements are combined and the array is sorted. 

**Time complexity
The algorithm works in O(n.logn). This is because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.
